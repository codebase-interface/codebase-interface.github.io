# Welcome

Welcome to the codebase interface documentation!

The codebase interface is a set of principles and practices that allow us to identify and understand all perspectives of interacting with a codebase, including contributors, users, operators, AI agents, and build agents.

By providing specific interfaces for each audience perspective, we can ensure that everyone has a clean and maintainable experience when interacting with a codebase.

## Support

If your codebase uses codebase principles please support the initiative by starring the [Codebase Interface GitHub repository](github.com/codebase-interface/codebaseinterface){target="_blank"} and placing the below markdown in the README of your repo.
