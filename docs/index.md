## 📁 Interface Example

<div class="interface-example" markdown>

Here's what a codebase interface looks like in practice:

```
my-project/
├── 📖 README.md                    # User interface - how to use the project
├── 🤝 CONTRIBUTING.md              # Contributor interface - how to contribute
├── 🖥️ RUNBOOK.md                   # Operator interface - how to deploy/operate
├── 🤖 AGENTS.md                    # AI Agent interface - how agents should interact
├── 📋 TODO.md                      # Outstanding tasks and roadmap
├── 📝 PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md     # Pull request template
├── ⚙️ Taskfile.yml                 # Unified task automation interface
├── 🎨 .editorconfig                # Code formatting standards
└── 📏 .gitattributes               # Git handling rules
```

**Key Benefits:**

- ✅ **Predictable** - Same structure across all projects
- 🚀 **Fast Onboarding** - New team members know exactly where to look
- 🤖 **AI-Friendly** - Automated tools understand your project structure
- 🔄 **Universal** - Works with any programming language or framework

## ⭐ Key Principles

<div class="principles-grid" markdown>

<div class="principle-card" markdown>
### 👤 Audience-Focused Interfaces
Every codebase should provide **clear interfaces** for its different audiences through standardized documentation files like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.
</div>

<div class="principle-card" markdown>
### 📋 Technology Agnostic  
The principles apply across **programming languages and frameworks**, promoting consistency whether you're working with Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, or any other technology.
</div>

<div class="principle-card" markdown>
### 🔧 Tool Integration
Leverage common tools like **Taskfile**, `.editorconfig`, and conventional commits for better developer experience and streamlined contributing methods.
</div>

<div class="principle-card" markdown>
### 🤖 Automation-Friendly
Designed with **AI agents and build systems** in mind, providing machine-readable interfaces for automated code analysis, generation, and deployment.
