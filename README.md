## Quick Start for Contributors

To set up the development environment and enable automatic changelog generation:

```bash
# Install dependencies
task setup
```

This will install required dependencies (MkDocs, plugins) for local development.

**Note**: The changelog is automatically generated via GitHub Actions when commits are pushed to main. Make sure to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification for proper changelog generation.
